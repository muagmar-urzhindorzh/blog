## Rules of decorating in accordance with ГОСТ 1.5-2001 and ГОСТ 7.1-2003

The actual text of the report should be typed on the computer in Times New Roman font size 14 pt. (Microsoft Word text editor is used for text design). It is recommended that the font used in the illustrative material (tables and figures) be reduced to 12 pt. The line spacing in the main text is one-and-a-half. In the illustrative material, it is recommended to make the line spacing single. Page margins should be:

- left field - 30 mm;

- right field - 10 mm;

- top and bottom margin - 20 mm.

Each paragraph should start with a red line. The indentation of the paragraph is 12.5 mm. from the left border of the text.

Each section of the report should start with a new page. The name of the structural elements of the report «CONTENTS», «INTRODUCTION», «CONCLUSION», «LIST OF LITERATURE», «ANNEX», as well as the headings of the sections should be printed in capital letters and be located in the middle of the line. Sections are numbered with Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3). No dot at the end of headings.



The headings of sections may be highlighted in bold. It is not allowed to use underlining in headings, use of two or more types of highlighting in headers (for example, italics and bold font, italics and other color other than the main text), moving words in chapter headings, as well as the use of non-standard characters in the report text, the use of abbreviations in headers. In the text of the report, abbreviations of terms are allowed only after the introduction of a meaningful definition of the term. All pages of the report (except the applications) should be numbered, starting with «Introduction», which is numbered with the digit 3. Page numbers are located in the center of the bottom of the sheet without a dot.

Illustrative material (tables, drawings, formulas) is included in the report in order to visualize the argumentation and substantiation of the conclusions received by the student. Thus, the main part of the report is only the material that contributes to a better substantiation of the conclusions reached by the student. Tables, reporting forms and other factual material, which are the raw data from which the study was based, are not included in the main body of work but may be annexed. It is recommended that tables and figures based on actual baseline data be included directly in the main body of the report. All illustrative material should, if possible, be placed after the first reference to it in the text.

Equations and formulas should be separated from the text into a separate row. Formulae should use as symbols the symbols established by the relevant state standards and reflected in the format of formulae. 

Literary sources used in the report writing process are specified at the end of the work before the application.

The report does not recommend retelling the content of textbooks, teaching aids, normative and specialized literature. This information should be refined and presented in the content of the work. Direct borrowing from sources without reference to the author or the instrument is not acceptable. When using digital data, official documents, quotations and other published material, a student must indicate the source and make a reference in square brackets. Example: [12, pp. 34], meaning: 12 - source number in the list of literature, 34 - page number. The attachment contains material supplementing the text of the report. For example, the data used for calculations; intermediate tables and charts that influenced the construction of final tables and figures; intermediate calculations showing the dynamics of the student’s evidence; description of algorithms; tables and drawings of non-standard format, etc. Applications are placed in the work after the list of literature. Each annex is sequentially numbered with Arabic numerals. If the application is more than one page, it is moved to another page and at the top is marked as «Continuation of the application ...». All applications should be referenced in the report text. The location of the annexes at the end of the document should follow the order in which the links to them appear in the text. Each application starts with a new page. In the upper right corner of the page, the word «ANNEX» is indicated and its serial number is placed (for example, «ANNEX 1»). Each application should have a header that appears on the next line after «ANNEX», and this header is centered around the text. If the documents have a large format, they should be stacked in A4 format. One page of this non-standard value is numbered as one page of the application (without adding it).
