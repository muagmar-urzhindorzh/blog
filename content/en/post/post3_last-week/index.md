Last week, I went on an unforgettable trip to China with my family, visiting the amazing city of Guangzhou. Here I was able to enjoy the beauty of modern museums and exhibitions, which amazed me with their diversity and uniqueness of exhibits.

During my stay in Guangzhou, I visited the Museum of Science and Technology, where I learned a lot about the development of science and technology in China. Then I went to the Museum of Art, where I saw the works of Chinese artists and sculptors created in different periods of the country's history.

In addition to visiting museums, I also decided to walk around the city and enjoy its architecture and atmosphere. I visited Panyu Market, where I bought souvenirs for my friends and relatives, and also tasted local cuisine at one of the restaurants in the city.
